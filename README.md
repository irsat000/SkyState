# About

I made this project as an assignment for job application. I didn't check Linkedin messages for a while, so I made it in 4 days instead of 10. 

It's responsive(compatible with all screens). 

I am using Geolocation API to get the user's coordinates and ipinfo.io to get the user's location names. Normally, I should be using another API to get city name with coordinates. I was going to change it but it's safe so why bother.

I am using Openstreetmap API to get searchbar suggestions and coordinates. And open-meteo API to get weather forecast.

Developed it with React. I recently started learning this library, learned more by developing this project.

Note that I am a full stack developer and I originally wanted to go back end. That's why I didn't learn front end frameworks like Vue until a month ago.

# How to run

You can run the project in two ways.

### Live

Simply go to https://irsat000.github.io/SkyState/

(It's case sensitive, "skystate" will give 404)

### Locally

Install npm. I am using 8.19.3

Open the project folder with VS Code and run "npm start".
